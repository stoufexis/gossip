/** To reduce the code and mental overhead of always having to check whether an address represents the current
  * node or a different node, this type, along with RemoteAddress are introduced. They allow for only checking
  * a single time, and marking the result of the check in the type system, allowing other functions to
  * explicitly request the type of address they require.
